# Core Framework - Template - Examples

This repository is the next evolution in CommonCore; simply called Core. Instead of using nuget to install the various packets and then manually setting up the project, this repository will provide solution templates that will kick things off.

- Core.Reference.zip: Contains a blank Solution with a single page and starter files and folders initialized.
- CommonCoreProjects.zip: Contains the shared projects for Core and extensions like SQlite, LiteDb and Fonts.
- Code Samples: Contains examples of how to use Core and the extensions.

  (NOTE) The template and examples require that you include Xamarin.Forms.Core shared project in order to compile and run.
